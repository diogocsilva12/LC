    "# Restrictions for Solvers in Bounded Model Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "When utilizing solvers like Z3 or PySMT for bounded model checking of the integer multiplication automaton, itâ€™s important to adhere to the following restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bit-Vector Size**:\n",
    "   - The bit-vector size (`n`) must be explicitly defined. In the provided code, `n` is set to 10, meaning all bit-vector variables will represent integers within the range \\([0, 2^{10}-1]\\).\n",
    "   - Ensure all operations respect the limits imposed by the bit-vector size to avoid overflow and undefined behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initial Values**:\n",
    "   - The initial values for `a` and `b` should be constrained to less than \\(2^{(n/2)}\\). This is to ensure that during the multiplication process, the resultant value will not exceed the maximum representable value in `n` bits.\n",
    "   - For example, if `n = 10`, both `a` and `b` should be less than \\(32\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Invariant Conditions**:\n",
    "   - The invariant \\(x \\times y + z = a \\times b\\) must be maintained throughout the state transitions. If this invariant does not hold at any state, it indicates a logical error in the multiplication implementation.\n",
    "   - The model checker must regularly assert that this invariant holds true after each transition between states.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Overflow Checks**:\n",
    "   - The solver must check for potential overflow conditions for all state variables. If any variable exceeds \\(2^n - 1\\), it indicates an overflow that the program must handle.\n",
    "   - Each state variable (`x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `z`) should be validated against the maximum value allowed for their respective bit-vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transition Validity**:\n",
    "   - All state transitions must be defined correctly and should maintain the logical structure of the multiplication algorithm.\n",
    "   - The transitions should ensure that the state machine can only move to valid next states according to the defined logic of multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bounded Model Checking Depth (K)**:\n",
    "   - The depth \\(K\\) defines how many states the model checker will verify. A larger \\(K\\) can provide more extensive verification but at the cost of increased computational complexity.\n",
    "   - Be mindful of the trade-off between the thoroughness of the checks and the performance of the solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Solver Limitations**:\n",
    "   - Different solvers may have limitations in terms of the size of the formulas they can handle. Always check the documentation for the specific limitations of the solver you are using.\n",
    "   - Performance can vary based on the structure of the constraints, so consider optimizing your constraints for better solver performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adhering to these restrictions is essential for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the model checking process when verifying the automaton that performs integer multiplication using bit-vectors.\n"
